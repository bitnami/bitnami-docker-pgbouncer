```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).


* [`1`, `1-debian-10`, `1.15.0`, `1.15.0-debian-10-r158`, `latest` (1/debian-10/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-pgbouncer/blob/1.15.0-debian-10-r158/1/debian-10/Dockerfile)

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami pgbouncer Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/pgbouncer).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/pgbouncer/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/pgbouncer:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/pgbouncer:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-pgbouncer.git#master:1/debian-10'
```

# Configuration

## Daemon settings

The following parameters can be set for the PgBouncer daemon:

## Authentication

The authentication mode can be set using the `PGBOUNCER_AUTH_TYPE` variable, which can be set to any of the values available [in the official PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html). In the case of the `md5` authentication type (default value), set the backend PostgreSQL credentials as explained in the [Backend PostgreSQL connection section](#backend-postgresql-connection).

## Backend PostgreSQL connection

The Bitnami PgBouncer container requires a running PostgreSQL installation to connect to. This is configured with the following environment variables.

- `POSTGRESQL_USERNAME`: Backend PostgreSQL username. Default: **postgres**.
- `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD`: Backend PostgreSQL password. No defaults.
- `POSTGRESQL_DATABASE`: Backend PostgreSQL Database name to connect to. Default: **postgres**.
- `POSTGRESQL_HOST`: Backend PostgreSQL hostname. Default: **postgresql**.
- `POSTGRESQL_PORT`: Backend PostgreSQL port. Default: **5432**.

## Port and address binding

The listening port and listening address can be configured with the following environment variables:

- `PGBOUNCER_PORT`: PgBouncer port. Default: **6432**.
- `PGBOUNCER_BIND_ADDRESS`: PgBouncer bind address. Default: **0.0.0.0**.

## Extra arguments to PgBouncer startup

In case you want to add extra flags to the PgBouncer command, use the `PGBOUNCER_EXTRA_ARGS` variable. Example:

```console
$ docker run --name pgbouncer \
  -e PGBOUNCER_EXTRA_ARGS="--verbose" \
  bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
```

## Other options

- `PGBOUNCER_IGNORE_STARTUP_PARAMETERS`: you can use this to set `ignore_startup_parameters` in the auto-generated `pgbouncer.ini`. This can be useful for solving certain connection issues. See https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html for more details.


## Initializing a new instance

When the container is launched, it will execute the files with extension `.sh` located at `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

In order to have your custom files inside the docker image you can mount them as a volume.

```console
$ docker run --name pgbouncer \
  -v /path/to/init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d \
  bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
```

Or with docker-compose

```yaml
pgbouncer:
  image: bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
  volumes:
    - /path/to/init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
```

## Securing PgBouncer traffic

PgBouncer supports the encryption of connections using the SSL/TLS protocol. Should you desire to enable this optional feature, you may use the following environment variables to configure the application:

 - `PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_SSLMODE`: TLS traffic settings. Defaults to `disable`. Check the [official PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html) for the available values for `client_tls_sslmode`.
 - `PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_CERT_FILE`: File containing the certificate file for the TLS traffic. No defaults.
 - `PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_KEY_FILE`: File containing the key for certificate. No defaults.
 - `PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_CA_FILE`: File containing the CA of the certificate. If provided, PgBouncer will authenticate TLS/SSL clients by requesting them a certificate . No defaults.
 - `PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_CIPHERS`: TLS ciphers to be used. Defaults to `fast`.Check the [official PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html) for the available values for `client_tls_ciphers`.

When enabling TLS, PgBouncer will support both standard and encrypted traffic by default, but prefer the latter. Below there are some examples on how to quickly set up TLS traffic:

1. Using `docker run`

    ```console
    $ docker run \
        -v /path/to/certs:/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs \
        -e PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_SSLMODE=require \
        -e PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs/pgbouncer.crt \
        -e PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs/pgbouncer.key \
        bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
    ```

2. Modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file present in this repository:

    ```yaml
    services:
      pgbouncer:
      ...
        environment:
          ...
          - PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_SSLMODE=require
          - PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs/pgbouncer.crt
          - PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs/pgbouncer.key
        ...
        volumes:
          ...
          - /path/to/certs:/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs
      ...
    ```

Alternatively, you may also provide this configuration in your [custom](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-pgbouncer#configuration-file) configuration file.

## Configuration file

The image looks for `pgbouncer.conf` file in `/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/conf/`. You can mount a volume at `/bitnami/pgbouncer/conf/` and copy/edit the `pgbouncer.conf` file in the `/path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/`. The default configurations will be populated to the `conf/` directory if it's empty.

```console
/path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/
└── pgbouncer.ini

0 directories, 1 file
```

As PgBouncer image is non-root, you need to set the proper permissions to the mounted directory in your host:
```console
sudo chown 1001:1001 /path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/
```

### Step 1: Run the PgBouncer image

Run the PgBouncer image, mounting a directory from your host.

```console
$ docker run --name pgbouncer \
    -v /path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/:/bitnami/pgbouncer/conf/ \
    bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

...

services:
  pgbouncer:
    image: 'bitnami/pgbouncer:latest'
    ports:
      - '6432:6432'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/:/bitnami/pgbouncer/conf/
```

### Step 2: Edit the configuration

Edit the configuration on your host using your favorite editor.

```console
vi /path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/pgbouncer.ini
```

### Step 3: Restart PgBouncer

After changing the configuration, restart your PgBouncer container for changes to take effect.

```console
$ docker restart pgbouncer
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose restart pgbouncer
```

Refer to the [server configuration](https://www.pgbouncer.org/usage.html) manual for the complete list of configuration options.
